# Stim
Experimental agent designed to take arbitrary inputs and prioritize between them in a live context

## Inspiration
Our mission is to explore non-linear agent architectures that operate in a more dynamic, contextual, and human-centric manner. As a starting point, we aim to build a prototype agent that can intake varied inputs in real-time and prioritize between them intelligently based on the live context.

The goal is to move beyond the limitations of linear, rule-based agents and enable more persistent, passive computing interactions. We draw inspiration from visions like the hyper-capable agents in Accelerando by Charles Stross, which highlight the potential for AI systems to operate autonomously with a keen sense of environmental context.

## What it does

Our prototype is a non-linear personal alert agent refers to an intelligent assistant that can monitor a user's environment, context, and preferences and proactively issue alerts and notifications in a dynamic, non-linear way. It will take continuous inputs from sources like sensors, APIs, and user conversations. 

**Key Features**
- **Input Flexibility**: STIM is built to accept input from a wide range of sources, including text, voice, data streams, APIs, sensors, and more. It can process diverse types of information.
- **Context Awareness**: The agent maintains an ongoing understanding of its environment and the user's preferences, adapting its prioritization based on the context. It takes into account the user's conversation history, preferences, and current activity.
- **Dynamic Prioritization**: STIM employs advanced algorithms and machine learning to dynamically prioritize incoming inputs. It assesses the relevance and importance of each input, allowing it to focus on the most significant and contextually relevant tasks.
- **Autonomous Learning**: Over time, STIM autonomously learns from user interactions and feedback, improving its prioritization capabilities and understanding of user preferences.
- **Notification and Alerts**: STIM can send notifications or alerts to the user based on the urgency and importance of incoming inputs. These notifications can be customized to fit the user's needs.
- **Persistent and Passive Operation**: Unlike traditional agents that require explicit commands, STIM operates passively in the background, proactively identifying and responding to relevant information without direct user prompts.
- **User Assistance**: The agent can provide assistance, recommendations, or actions based on the prioritized inputs. For example, it can suggest tasks, answer questions, or initiate actions autonomously.
