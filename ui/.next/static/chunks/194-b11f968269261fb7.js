Chat\n\n### 4.1 Getting started\n\nTo keep chat history, we use a variant of the previous chain called a `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain`.\nFirst, specify a `Memory buffer` to track the conversation inputs / outputs.\n\n\n```typescript\nimport { ConversationalRetrievalQAChain } from "langchain/chains";\nimport { BufferMemory } from "langchain/memory";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\n\nconst memory = new BufferMemory({\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  returnMessages: true,\n});\n```\n\nNext, we initialize and call the chain:\n\n```typescript\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-3.5-turbo" });\nconst chain = ConversationalRetrievalQAChain.fromLLM(model, vectorstore.asRetriever(), {\n  memory\n});\n\nconst result = await chain.call({\n  question: "What are some of the main ideas in self-reflection?"\n});\nconsole.log(result);\n\n/*\n{\n  text: \'Some main ideas in self-reflection include:\n\' +\n    \'\n\' +\n    \'1.

These reflections are then added to the agent\'s working memory as context for querying a language model. The agent uses this self-reflection information to make decisions on whether to start a new trial or continue with the current plan."\n}\n*/\n```\n\n\n### 4.2 Going deeper\n\nThe [documentation](/docs/modules/chains/popular/chat_vector_db) on `ConversationalRetrievalQAChain` offers a few extensions, such as streaming and source documents.\n\n\n# Conversational Retrieval Agents\n\nThis is an agent specifically optimized for doing retrieval when necessary while holding a conversation and being able\nto answer questions based on previous dialogue in the conversation.\n\nTo start, we will set up the retriever we want to use, then turn it into a retriever tool. Next, we will use the high-level constructor for this type of agent.\nFinally, we will walk through how to construct a conversational retrieval agent from components.\n\n## The Retriever\n\nTo start, we need a retriever to use! The code here is mostly just example code. Feel free to use your own retriever and skip to the next section on creating a retriever tool.\n\n```typescript\nimport { FaissStore } from "langchain/vectorstores/faiss";\nimport { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "langchain/embeddings/openai";\nimport { TextLoader } from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/text";\nimport { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter";\n\nconst loader = new TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt");\nconst docs = await loader.load();\nconst splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({\n  chunkSize: 1000,\n  chunkOverlap: 0\n});\n\nconst texts = await splitter.splitDocuments(docs);\n\nconst vectorStore = await FaissStore.fromDocuments(texts, new OpenAIEmbeddings());\n\nconst retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever();\n```\n\n## Retriever Tool\n\nNow we need to create a tool for our retriever. The main things we need to pass in are a `name` for the retriever as well as a `description`. These will both be used by the language model, so they should be informative.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createRetrieverTool } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\n\nconst tool = createRetrieverTool(retriever, {\n  name: "search_state_of_union",\n  description: "Searches and returns documents regarding the state-of-the-union.",\n});\n```\n\n## Agent Constructor\n\nHere, we will use the high level `create_conversational_retrieval_agent` API to construct the agent.\nNotice that beside the list of tools, the only thing we need to pass in is a language model to use.\n\nUnder the hood, this agent is using the OpenAIFunctionsAgent, so we need to use an ChatOpenAI model.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createConversationalRetrievalAgent } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\n\nconst model = new ChatOpenAI({\n  temperature: 0,\n});\n\nconst executor = await createConversationalRetrievalAgent(model, [tool], {\n  verbose: true,\n});\n```\n\nWe can now try it out!\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await executor.call({\n  input: "Hi, I\'m Bob!"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: \'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?\',\n    intermediateSteps: []\n  }\n*/\n\nconst result2 = await executor.call({\n  input: "What\'s my name?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result2);\n\n/*\n  { output: \'Your name is Bob.\', intermediateSteps: [] }\n*/\n\nconst result3 = await executor.call({\n  input: "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the most recent state of the union?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result3);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: "In the most recent state of the union, President Biden mentioned Ketanji Brown Jackson. He nominated her as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge and described her as one of the nation\'s top legal minds who will continue Justice Breyer\'s legacy of excellence. He mentioned that she has received a broad range of support, including from the Fraternal Order of Police and former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.",\n    intermediateSteps: [\n      {...}\n    ]\n  }\n*/\n\nconst result4 = await executor.call({\n  input: "How long ago did he nominate her?"\n});\n\nconsole.log(result4);\n\n/*\n  {\n    output: \'President Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson four days before the most recent state of the union address.\',\n    intermediateSteps: []\n  }\n*/\n```\n\nNote that for the final call, the agent used previously retrieved information to answer the query and did not need to call the tool again!\n\nHere\'s a trace showing how the agent fetches documents to answer the question with the retrieval tool:\n\nhttps://smith.langchain.com/public/1e2b1887-ca44-4210-913b-a69c1b8a8e7e/r\n\n## Creating from components\n\nWhat actually is going on underneath the hood? Let\'s take a look so we can understand how to modify things going forward.\n\n### Memory\n\nIn this example, we want the agent to remember not only previous conversations, but also previous intermediate steps.\nFor that, we can use `OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory`. Note that if you want to change whether the agent remembers intermediate steps,\nhow the long the retained buffer is, or anything like that you should change this part.\n\n```typescript\nimport { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\n\nconst memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({\n  llm: model,\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  outputKey: "output"\n});\n```\n\nYou should make sure `memoryKey` is set to `"chat_history"` and `outputKey` is set to `"output"` for the OpenAI functions agent.\nThis memory also has `returnMessages` set to `true` by default.\n\nYou can also load messages from prior conversations into this memory by initializing it with a pre-loaded chat history:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";\nimport { OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory } from "langchain/agents/toolkits";\nimport { HumanMessage, AIMessage } from "langchain/schema";\nimport { ChatMessageHistory } from "langchain/memory";\n\nconst previousMessages = [\n  new HumanMessage("My name is Bob"),\n  new AIMessage("Nice to meet you, Bob!"),\n];\n\nconst chatHistory = new ChatMessageHistory(previousMessages);\n\nconst memory = new OpenAIAgentTokenBufferMemory({\n  llm: new ChatOpenAI({}),\n  memoryKey: "chat_history",\n  outputKey: "output",\n  chatHistory,\n});\n```\n\n### Agent executor\n\nWe can recreate the agent executor directly with the `initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions` method.\nThis allows us to customize the agent\'s system message by passing in a `prefix` into `agentArgs`.\nImportantly, we must pass in `return_intermediate_steps: true` since we are recording that with our memory object.\n\n```typescript\nimport { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "langchain/agents";\n\nconst executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, llm, {\n  agentType: "openai-functions",\n  memory,\n  returnIntermediateSteps: true,\n  agentArgs: {\n    prefix:\n      prefix ??\n      `Do your best to answer the questions. Feel free to use any tools available to look up relevant information, only if necessary.`,\n  },\n});\n```\n'),a=async e=>{e.preventDefault(),n(!0);let o=await
